### Hi, I'm Mihir ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a high school senior at Amity International School studying Maths, Economics, Business Studies, Accountancy, and Informatics Practices.

I'm interested in data science and primarily use Python for it. I also work with Python for programming and Java for native Android, and have previously worked with Node.js for web.
